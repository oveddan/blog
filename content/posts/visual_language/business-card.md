For our final homework assignment in Visual Language, we were to design a logo and business card for ourselves.

Earlier in the semseter, when I heard that this would be our final project, I was both excited and terrified.
This proved to be very challenging in the end. When it finally came time to work on this, 
I found myself frequently criticizing my designs, starting over, and letting out a highly audible sigh that made those around me chuckle.

With time running out, I settled on this:

For the logo, I wanted to portray something both connected and dynamic, and [Voronoi cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) fit this criteria.
I used a modified version of Inigo Quillez' [Voronoi Lines shader code](http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/voronoilines/voronoilines.htm) in Processing, and
rendered the shader in a circle. I then imported this generated image into Illustrator.

I used the golden ratio to position the elements on both the front and back of the card. 

#  My thoughts 

I'm glad to have completed this class.  All of the homework assignments were both intimidating and painful - which in the end is a good thing it consistently challenged me 
to step out of my comfort zone.  In the past I'd avoid design completely and hand it off to other people; now I have more confidence
and an understanding of what works and doesn't work to take this on myself. 

I'd like to take more courses on this subject.
