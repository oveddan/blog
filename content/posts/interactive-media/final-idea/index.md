    "For my final project, I want to do a live performance that is controlled both by me and generated by randomness. I want to have liquids that are associated with sounds, and mix them together live on stage in containers. I will have a camera pointed at the containers which will pick up the shapes and colors of the liquids and the forms of their mixing. These forms will determine both the modulation of the sounds and their positions on the speakers in the room. I will display what the camera is seeing on a projector, so its clear to the audience what is happening. Im thinking to arrange the containers on a sequencer, and being able to activate steps of the sequence by turning on lights that shine on the containers."

For my final project, I want to do a live performance that is controlled both by me and generated by randomness.  I want to have liquids that are associated with sounds, and mix them together live on stage in containers.  I will have a camera pointed at the containers which will pick up the shapes and colors of the liquids and the forms of their mixing.  These forms will determine both the modulation of the sounds and their positions on the speakers in the room.  I will display what the camera is seeing on a projector, so its clear to the audience what is happening.  Im thinking to arrange the containers on a sequencer, and being able to activate steps of the sequence by turning on lights that shine on the containers.  

The way the liquids could mix could vary, such as by adding drops and watching them slowly fill up the container, observing oils and waters separating, or using dyes that activate when a certain ph level of a liquid is reached.  These changes could trigger transitions in a composition.
