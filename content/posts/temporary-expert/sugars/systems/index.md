## Our first assignment

For the first assignment of The Temporary Expert, in which we are to create an "Energy Field Guide" 
on a randomly selected subject, my topic is Sugars.

I first outlined all the systems relating to sugars:

* Psychological factors in consumption of sugar
* Addiction to Sugar
* Sugary food packaging
* The sugar processing/refinement industry
* Marketing/advertising of sugary foods.
* Sugar content of food
* Efforts by government to reduce sugar intake.
* Nutritional Recommendations for Sugar Consumption
* Sugars role in Diabetes
* Sugar in Nature
* Food & beverage manufacture
* Addiction to sugars
* Binging on sugary foods
* Sugar consumption in developing countries/low-income communities
* Positivie & Negative effects of Sugar on human health
* Sugars as a source of energy
* Sugars as a part of carbohydrates

As someone who goes on late night ice cream binges, craves sugary cereals, and orders juices with the most flavor (and likely the highest sugar contant)
I became particularly interested in the relationship of industry's processing and marketing of sugar in foods for profit
and societies' consumption and addition to these foods. I organized everything into a hierarchical system map
composing of these two major systems and their sub-systems with related ones next to each other:

## My thoughts/intentions with this class

Much of my work until now has been about making something that is aesthetically pleasing or innovative from a technology standpoint.  
As I am passionate about subjects affecting the world today, I would like my work to be rooted in concepts that explore these topics.
I'm hoping that through this class I will learn to build a framework of research and meaning around my work.
