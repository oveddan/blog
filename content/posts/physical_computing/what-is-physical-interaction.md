According to Chris Crawford in [The Art of Interactive Design](https://itp.nyu.edu/~ym349/pc/theartofinteractivedesign.pdf), Physical interaction is where a human interfaces with another entity, such as a person or computer, and that entity responds based on that action. Â It must be two-way; uni-directional communication is not interaction.

Examples of physical interaction:

* Typing in a text editor and seeing letters appearing.
* Painting with hand-help controllers in virtual reality.
* Having a conversation with another person.
* Playing a competitive sport.

By this definition, physical interaction is not:

* Reading a newspaper.
* Looking at art in a gallery.
* Watching a speech.
* Jogging

Examples of usages of digital technology that are not interactive:

* Listening to a podcast.
* Watching a video on youtube.
* Watching 360 video in VR.
* Reading blog posts.

 I'm looking exploring new forms of physical interaction at ITP!
