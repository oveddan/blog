For our first homework assignment for Homemade Hardware, we are to create a breadboard ATtiny project, using a sensor of your choosing that controls an LED.
I chose the ultrasonic distance sensor, since I've never used it, and can see many uses for it.

Here is a hand-drawn schematic of how it would be hooked up to an ATTiny85:
