Here is a summary of the work my groups did during the Soft Sensing class:

## Materials Testing 

I worked with Vidia Anindhita.  To see the results of our tests, refer to her blog post:

## Sensor Sprints 

I worked with Dongphil Yoo and Anita K on our sensor sprint.  We made two sensors, a stretch sensor that attaches to a hammock and indicates if someone is sittign on it,
and a squishy sensor that was mixed with non-resistive material and put into a mini stuffed doll.  To see our documentation refer to [Anita's blog post.](https://wp.nyu.edu/anita17/2018/10/04/soft-sensing-3rd-assignment/)

## Research Group

For my research grou I worked with Anita.  We decided to make a basic version of the z-patch.  For documentation refer to [Anita's blog post.](https://wp.nyu.edu/anita17/2018/10/04/soft-sensing-4th-assignment/)
