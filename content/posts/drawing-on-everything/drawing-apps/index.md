For the first homework assignment of Drawing on Everything, we were instructed to try 3 drawing apps. Here are my experiences with a few of them:

### Autocad Sketchbook
I used this app to draw a skyline on my IPhone.  I found it very challenging to draw on such a small screen with
my finger.  A better medium would likely have been an IPad.  My other concerns lies with the inconsistency of the
marker sizes between each marker.  If you select one it can have a tiny stroke while another one a massive stroke.  
This isn't clear from the UI and results in a poor drawing experience.  Here is what I drew, after realizing I couldn't 
obtain any sort of realism on this medium, I drew random lines to fill in the spaces:

### KidsDoodle

I drew a plant in this app.  I liked the feeling of it.  It had an ad but it wasn't intrusive or that noticeable.  I enjoyed
the stroke style and how the color changed between strokes, getting rid of needing to make the decision of color
and giving a fun feeling to the experience that both kids and adults like myself can enjoy;  because it feels more like
drawing freely than Sketchbook, inaccuracies do not matter:

### Just a Line

I enjoyed this drawing experience as it really took advantage of the 3d space.  That being said, I found it challenging
to draw what I was thinking since the drawings were done in mid-air and scale became confusing.  It would be interesting to create
a drawing app like this where the lines were attached to the walls or furniture.  This would let you in essence draw on real objects in 3d.
