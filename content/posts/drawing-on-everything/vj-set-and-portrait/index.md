## VJ Set

For this weeks Drawing on Everything homework, we had to create a vj setup and then record a mini performance of it.
I chose the track [Tiefschwarz - Downstairs (Golffinch Remix)](https://www.beatport.com/track/downstairs-goldffinch-remix/8270574)
after hearing it on [Richie Hawtin's BBC Radio Christmas special](https://soundcloud.com/richiehawtin/bbc-radio-1-btraits-richie-hawtin-christmas-special). 
The vj set had to be composed of videos we shot with our phones.  I used Touch Designer for my set, heavily linking morphing of the videos to the levels of the bass.

## Portraits

We were also to take a portrait of a stranger.  I had two attempts; I had wanted them to look at the camera but in both cases they didn't:

{{<fullsizeimage src="images/portrait_poet" caption="A poem writer at the Pakatakan Farmers' Market in the catskills.  I asked him first if I could take his picture and he said sure, but unfortunately never looked directly at the camera.">}}

{{<fullsizeimage src="images/portrait_coffee" caption="The coffee shop owner at Vittoria cafe in Williamsburg. I also asked him if I could take his portrait, he said sure and looked at my phone but unfortunately when it captured his eyes were closed.">}}
