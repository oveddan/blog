<p>This is our submission for <a href="http://eroft.decontextualize.com/">Electronic Rituals, Oracles and Fortune Telling</a> <a href="http://eroft.decontextualize.com/schedule#meditation-1-assigned">Meditation #1,</a>
in which we are to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine an “electronic” ritual and prototype the necessary systems to perform the ritual. Then perform the ritual and document the process.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I constantly struggle with making decisions, and my fear of doing so makes me put things off to the last minute.  If I just made decisions and stuck with them,
I&rsquo;d be a lot more productive and feel less anxiety.  Many times I think too much about each choice when in reality the thigns I&rsquo;m worried about do not really matter.
All decisions have pros and cons, and we need to accept them for what they are and not be afraid.  This app is just about making a decision.  But most importantly
it helps us acknowledge when we are stuck.</p>

<p>With Tong Wu as my collaborator, we created the <strong>Indecision Space</strong>, accessed at <a href="http://www.indecision.space">indecision.space</a>, a place you go to when you are having difficulty making a decision.  In the app the user:</p>

<ol>
<li>Acknowledges that they are undecided</li>
<li>Is encouraged to think about the decision and the choices</li>
<li>Gets vague guidance from an oracle on which choice to make</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-makes-this-a-ritual">What makes this a ritual?</h2>

<p>This is something that we do all the time.  By formalizing the process and repeating it, we are in essence ritualizing it.  The act
of acknowledging we are struggling with being undecided is the entrace to this ritual.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The central role that religion plays in people&rsquo;s lives is to get things done, to make things right and to keep them that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This experience is essentially a decision maker.  We can use the oracles advice to decide and help us &ldquo;get things done.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-important-for-the-person">Why is this important for the person?</h2>

<p>This can help the person make decisions and move on with their lives.  It can help them realize that no decision is perfect, and that
in the end it doesn&rsquo;t really matter so much.  Both paths have merits.</p>

<p>For MH he said, &ldquo;the fact that it said it has to do with something real&rdquo; made him go for it.  We all went for it.  In reality we are just
seeking some sort of validation for something, this app provides that.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-it-important-for-the-world">Why is it important for the world?</h2>

<p>If this kind of practice is taken across the world we could all feel less afraid to make decisions.  We would more go with the flow
and not be scare to do something.</p>
