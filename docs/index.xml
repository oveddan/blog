      <title>My Colors and Compositions</title>

      <description>For this Visual Language homework assignment, I was tasked to pick a color scheme that represents me, and create six compositions using those colors.
The Color Scheme I chose the theme inspired by Tame Impala &amp;lsquo;Currents&amp;rsquo; from The Day&amp;rsquo;s Color:
 This colors in this theme theme are both vibrant and diverse. To me, this represents how I&amp;rsquo;m always learning different things, and using them in innovative ways to create something exciting.</description>

      <title>Light Loop</title>

      <description>The Features The goal of this project is to use analog input and digital input to drive digital output.
This is accomplished by detecting when a photoresistor, an analog input, gets a certain amount of light. When that happens, it triggers an animation on the opposite end of the LEDS which travels through them back towards the photoresistor. When the photoresistor picks up enough light from the animation that has reached it, it triggers the start of the animation again.</description>

      <description>For this homework assignment we were to design 3 expressive words that visually communicate their meanings. Here is what I created:

      <description>Original Design For this homework assignment we were to take the boarding pass below and redesign it:
 
My Redesign   Icons used: Door and Airplane Seat from The Noun Project
My design assumes that the passenger gets this boarding pass at the check-in counter or kiosk, and the stub on the right is torn off and handed to the passenger at the gate. The information hierarchy is organized to make it quick to find the most important information at every part of the way from the check-in counter to the seat.</description>

      <title>Doubling the Battery Power</title>
      <link>https://oveddan.github.io/blog/posts/physical_computing/batteries-in-parallel/</link>

      <description>A project I worked on this past summer required a portable power source of 3.3 - 4 volts. I used the Tenergy Li-Ion 3.7v 2600 mAH rechargeable battery, connected to the Adafruit LiPoly backpack charger and a Teensy 3.2. In this system, the battery would be drained after only about half an hour; I wanted to increase the capacity but did not know how.
Then last week, for my Basic Analog Circuit course, I learned about connecting multiple batteries in parallel to maintain the same voltage but increase the current and capacity by connecting the powers and grounds together of the batteries.</description>

      <title>Designing for Digital Fabrication - Drawing a Real World Object in Vectorworks</title>

      <description>Our first homework assignment for Daniel Rozin&amp;rsquo;s Designing for Digital Fabrication class was to draw three 2d perspectives of a real world object in Vectorworks. I took this as an opportunity to get the exact dimensions of an object I&amp;rsquo;ve been eager to to incorporate into a project.
At the Armory show in 2015, I discovered and was amazed by the low-resolution work of Jim Campbell.

      <title>Visual Language - This Is a Good and Bad Sign</title>
      <link>https://oveddan.github.io/blog/posts/visual_language/this-is-a-good-and-bad-sign/</link>

      <description>For this homework assignment, we are to show two examples each of successful and unsuccessful signs, then redesign one of the bad signs.
Unsuccessful Signs V-Nam cafe, on 1st and 1st, is in my opinion the best Vietnamese restaurant in New York City. I used to live a block away and would walk by it all the time, but had no idea it existed until discovering it through Yelp.</description>

      <title>An Example of Good Design</title>

      <description>This last Sunday I was at a rooftop party at Output in Williamsburg and noticed my friend drinking what looked like a perfectly refreshing beverage – a can of Babe Rosé. Before even tasting her drink I decided to get one for myself, figuring it would be the perfect drink to enjoy during the sunset. In retrospect – the sleek, clean, and elegant design of the slender can is what lured me in.</description>

      <title>What Is Physical Interaction?</title>
      <link>https://oveddan.github.io/blog/posts/physical_computing/what-is-physical-interaction/</link>

      <guid>https://oveddan.github.io/blog/posts/physical_computing/what-is-physical-interaction/</guid>
      <description>According to Chris Crawford in The Art of Interactive Design, Physical interaction is where a human interfaces with another entity, such as a person or computer, and that entity responds based on that action. It must be two-way; uni-directional communication is not interaction.
Examples of physical interaction:
 Typing in a text editor and seeing letters appearing. Painting with hand-help controllers in virtual reality. Having a conversation with another person. Playing a competitive sport.</description>

      <title>Finally fulfilling a ten-year-old goal of starting a blog and posting something.</title>

      <description>Today was the final day of orientation for ITP. Thanks goes out to the residents for giving us great workshops on creating documentation and how to create a blog, then forcing us do it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to since I started coding, but each time my fear of public writing has turned into infinite procrastination.
One of the biggest takeaways from this talk is that even if you build something amazing, if no one sees and learns from it, then it&amp;rsquo;s pretty wasteful.</description>
