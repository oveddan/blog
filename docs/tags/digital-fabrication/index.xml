      <description>For Intro to Physical Computing this week, we were to play test our final project with our classmates.
For the Gaze Project, I set up the following for the test:
Assumptions  Initially - people will try to follow the animation with their eyes, but they will notice that doing that causes it to go away. They will eventually learn to focus on one point and see the animation grow with their peripherals.</description>

      <title>The Gaze Project - Proposal</title>

      <description>This is the proposal for the Gaze Project, an art piece that is activated the longer and the more people gaze directly at it. It would encourage being present and engaged, and connect the fellow participants with each other over moments of mindfulness. This will be my final project for Intro to Physical Computing and Design for Digital Fabrication.
I will use small cameras and computer vision to detect the quantify of people present and how many of them are gazing at a specific point, and reveal parts of the piece using motors and other physical controls.</description>

      <title>From Shader to Physical Animation - the Voronoi Cellular Zoetrope</title>

      <description>This is a continuation of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Zeotrope project.
Motivation This was the final phase of our homework assignment for Design for Digital Fabrication which was to design something algorithmically and laser cut it. Now that the mechanics of the Zoetrope animation were proven out the previous week, it was time to generate something elaborate. I was particularly inspired by John Edmark&amp;rsquo;s animated bloom sculptures:   After seeing what he made, my goal was to create an animation that:</description>

      <description>This is a continuation of Part 1 of the Zeotrope project for my Design for Digital Fabrication class. The final phase can be seen in Part 3
The next step of the project was to prototype the mechanics of the animation. The main questions were:
 How many frames of animation are optimal? What should the rotation speed be? At what rate should the lights flash?  The Rotation Mechanism - a Turntable There were many examples of Zoetropes on the web - the majority of them used a turntable to rotate the animation.</description>

      <description>See Part 2 and Part 3 of this project.
 For our first project for Designing for Digital Fabrication, we are to create something using the laser cutter, with at least some of the geometry generated algebraically. We have two weeks to complete this.
Inspiration I searched for inspirations for a project like this and ended up discovering the Zoetrope and being blown away by what people have done with it:</description>

      <title>Designing for Digital Fabrication - Drawing a Real World Object in Vectorworks</title>

      <description>Our first homework assignment for Daniel Rozin&amp;rsquo;s Designing for Digital Fabrication class was to draw three 2d perspectives of a real world object in Vectorworks. I took this as an opportunity to get the exact dimensions of an object I&amp;rsquo;ve been eager to to incorporate into a project.
At the Armory show in 2015, I discovered and was amazed by the low-resolution work of Jim Campbell.
