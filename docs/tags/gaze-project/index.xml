      <description>For Intro to Physical Computing this week, we were to play test our final project with our classmates.
For the Gaze Project, I set up the following for the test:
Assumptions  Initially - people will try to follow the animation with their eyes, but they will notice that doing that causes it to go away. They will eventually learn to focus on one point and see the animation grow with their peripherals.</description>

      <title>The Gaze Project - Proposal</title>

      <description>This is the proposal for the Gaze Project, an art piece that is activated the longer and the more people gaze directly at it. It would encourage being present and engaged, and connect the fellow participants with each other over moments of mindfulness. This will be my final project for Intro to Physical Computing and Design for Digital Fabrication.
I will use small cameras and computer vision to detect the quantify of people present and how many of them are gazing at a specific point, and reveal parts of the piece using motors and other physical controls.</description>
